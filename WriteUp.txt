The air is palpable with excitement as the Buds take to the ice, and boy, do we have a game to talk about!\n\n**First Period:**\n\nThe action kicks off, and just 11 minutes in, the Capitals draw first blood with a goal from T. Raddysh, assisted by C. McMichael and P. Dubois. The Buds find themselves on the back foot early, but you know we’re never out of it! The crowd is on edge, but what’s this? Just a minute later, it’s Bobby “The Man” McMann who answers right back, lighting the lamp with a beauty! JT and Holmberg set him up perfectly, and the Buds tie it up at 1-1. \n\nBut the Caps aren’t done yet! With just 2 minutes left in the first, D. Strome buries one, with help from A. Protas and M. Roy. Just like that, it’s 2-1 Caps as the first period winds down, and the Leafs trail again. You can feel the tension in the building; the Leafs need to regroup!\n\n**Second Period:**\n\nThings start heating up early in the second, and just two minutes in, P. Holmberg gets caught boarding. A tough break for the Buds as they’ve got to kill off this penalty. But wait! The Caps’ J. Chychrun gives the Leafs a break, slashing his way to the box just three minutes later. We’re back to 4-on-4 action! \n\nWith the game still knotted, it’s a tough moment when A. Protas extends the Capitals’ lead, lighting the lamp at the 17-minute mark with assists from Sandin and Ovechkin, making it 3-1. The Buds need to dig deep – but don’t count them out yet!\n\n**Third Period:**\n\nInto the third, and the Leafs ramp up the pressure! At the 15-minute mark, Willy Nylander dashes through the defense and finds the back of the net, assisted by The Mutant himself, M. Knies! What a goal! It’s 3-2, and the hope is back in the building!\n\nAs the minutes wind down, the Capitals’ N. Dowd gets a late cross-checking penalty, granting the Buds a power-play opportunity! And boy, oh boy, do they take advantage! Just as the penalty is cruising toward its end, Shambles himself, Mitch Marner, slams one home, with helpers from Riles and Willy! We’re tied at 3-3, and the momentum is surging!\n\n**Overtime:**\n\nThis is what we live for, folks! Overtime! Just four minutes in, and it’s the Amulet, John Tavares, who takes matters into his own hands! With Marner once again providing the magic, JT finds a seam and decides the game! And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, the Leafs pull it off in overtime, winning 4-3!\n\nWhat a comeback! What tenacity and grit from our Buds! Every time the Caps scored, the Leafs answered back, showing just how resilient they are. Coach Craig Berube has to be proud tonight! Keep that energy rolling, Leafs Nation! The boys are on fire, and we’re looking forward to the next game! Go Leafs Go!', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
